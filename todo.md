# TODO List
## Features to Add
 1. Implement usage counter for hashed URLs
 2. Add ability to set usage limit for hashed URLs

 2. Improve error handling for invalid hashed URLs

## Refactoring
 1. Improve code documentation
 2. Extract usage counter and limit logic into separate module
 3. Extract database logic into separate module
 4. Extract hashing logic into separate module
 5. Use a more secure hashing algorithm (e.g. SHA-512)

 ## Miscellaneous
 1. Add license to repository
